1. **protected**

- No data such as credentials are held onsite, they are transported to the mongodb cluster and all passwords are encrypted with Bcrypt

2. **simple to setup**

- just change the values in .env to get started!

3. **open-source!**

- unlike discord, this version is open source and free like discord!
